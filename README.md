# Image Carousel

https://thedanitor.github.io/image_carousel/

This project is from the Day 35 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

This was a simple, but effective image carousel that automatically moves to the next image after 2 seconds, but can also be manually cycled through using prev and next buttons. It was good practice setting and clearing intervals and using translateX to move the images inside the container. Using the object-fit CSS property was key to getting the images to be the right size and aspect ratio.
